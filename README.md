# BTD6 v40 Notification

**I have currently hidden Boss Rounds from the Mod Browser for the moment until a workaround can be found for v40.**
**A core feature of the mod, being able to save the Boss Rounds games to the map's save slots, has been made seemingly unpatchable as a side effect of v40, and without that the main functionality of the mod won't be operational.**

**Until a workaround can be found, stick with the new official Boss Challenges that NK has added.**

<h1 align="center">Boss Rounds</h1>

Adds Round Sets for all Bosses and their Elite versions chooseable in the Round Set Changer, allowing you to play any
boss on any map at any time. Sandbox also works, allowing you to test Bosses by sending their corresponding rounds.

You DO NOT receive the usual boss rewards / trophies for playing, instead you just get a nice chunk of extra Monkey
Money.

Saving and loading on maps is fully functional, but know that you'll need to have the mod still installed when opening
saves again for it to work.
